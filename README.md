Stronger Fishing Rods
=====================

A Minecraft Paper plugin that makes the strength of fishing rods configurable.

Because hooking your friends with fishing rods wasn't funny enough already.

Configuration
-------------

Below is the default configuration of the plugin. This can be edited in `plugins/StrongerFishingRods/config.yml`.

```yaml
# The strength that the fishing rod should have. Greater strength -> stronger pull
strength: 0.4
# Whether using a fishing rod on an entity should aggravate it
# This also means that kill credit will be given for fishing rod kills
rod-aggression: false
```
